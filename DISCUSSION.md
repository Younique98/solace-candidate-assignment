## Unfinished Tasks and Future Enhancements
While I am proud of the progress I made during this assignment, there are areas I wish I could have delved deeper into, given more time and resources. Below is a detailed discussion of what I couldn't accomplish and my intentions for these areas.

### 1. **Data Validation**
Although I implemented TypeScript for type safety and added error handling mechanisms with React Query, I was unable to implement comprehensive data validation at the API and frontend layers. Proper validation would ensure:
- Accurate data format and content.
- User feedback for incorrect or incomplete input.
- Prevention of edge-case errors.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
I aimed to make the advocate matching table mobile-friendly, focusing on a **mobile-first design**. However, I couldn't fully achieve:
- A responsive table view for smaller devices.
- Breakpoints for various screen sizes to enhance usability on all platforms.
- Design optimizations for touch interactions.

### 3. **Testing**
I wasn't able to write automated tests due to the time constraints. Adding unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests would:
- Ensure code reliability and maintainability.
- Catch bugs before they reach production.
- Validate new features during development.

### 4. **Accessibility (a11y)**
Although I improved the UI/UX, I couldn't fully focus on accessibility features such as:
- Proper ARIA roles for the table and search functionality.
- Keyboard navigation support.
- Screen reader compatibility.

### 5. **UI/UX Refinements**
Some design refinements were left incomplete:
- Polished advocate card designs for better readability and visual appeal.
